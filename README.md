### What is this?

#### The next go-to anime streaming information website.

Find out when your favourite anime airs and where you can watch it. In the near future, you will be able to organize your watch list per streaming platform (integration with anime-management sites like Anilist or MAL may be implemented).

#### How can I use it?

You can visit [youranime.moe](https://youranime.moe) to get started.

##### With Docker

You can run the application without checking-out the code and building app. All images are published on the official Docker Hub, under my username (https://hub.docker.com/r/drummeraki/tanoshimu).

The `postgres` docker image is required for the app to run. `redis` is required for sidekiq to run (background jobs, but mostly for seeding data), but optional for the app itself.

Initial setup: create an environment file

```bash
# Create an .env
cat <<EOF > .env
TANOSHIMU_SPACE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
TANOSHIMU_SPACE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
POSTGRES_USER=anime
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=isyourstoconquer
EOF
```

Database setup

```bash
# Create network and initialize database container in the background
docker network create tanoshimu
docker run --rm --env-file .env --network=tanoshimu --hostname=db --detach postgres

# Set up the database
docker run --rm --network=tanoshimu --env-file .env drummeraki/tanoshimu:dev bin/rails db:create db:migrate
```

Start the server

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm --network=tanoshimu --env-file .env drummeraki/tanoshimu:dev
```

Test the API with cURL (or any other client like Postman). The following should print how many shows exist (there won't be any unless data is seeded into the DB).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"query": "{browseAll {pageInfo {totalCount}}}"}'
```

Optional: seeding data

> Note: seeding data from Kitsu may require secrets

```bash
# Optional: seed the data
# Start redis in the background
docker run --rm --network=tanoshimu --hostname=redis --detach redis

# Start sidekiq in the background (you may need to wait for redis to be created)
docker run --rm --network=tanoshimu --env-file .env --detach drummeraki/tanoshimu:dev bundle exec sidekiq -q active_storage_analysis -q active_storage_purge -q batch_queue -q sync -q default

# Seed the database
docker run --rm --network=tanoshimu --env-file .env drummeraki/tanoshimu:dev bin/rails db:seed
```

You can check the progress by viewing the logs for the image `drummeraki/tanoshimu:dev` running the `entrypoint.sh bundle exec sidekiq...` command, using `docker ps`. More info on `docker logs` on the [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs).

#### Technologies

The following technologies made this app into what it is today:

- [Ruby on Rails 7.0](http://rubyonrails.org/) (Server-side and API development)
- [React](https://reactjs.org) (A JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) (React components for faster and easier web development)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) (A graph-based query language, alternative to REST)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (For running in app in a containerized environment)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) (Used mostly for background jobs and proxy security)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) (Alternative to AWS)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (Hosting the front-end application)

#### How do I contribute or check out the project?

I do not accept public contributions at the moment. Please contact me by email if you wish to run the project locally. Please note that this is not my full time job so I may take a little before answering. ðŸ˜…

#### Is this project alive?

Yes.

### About Tanoshimu

This project was originally called _My Akinyele_ and was running Rails 4. The UI and the code design
were terrible so I decided to change everything in January 2017 for the best. A big change was the use of
Slim and the heavy use of Bootstrap (as well as better overall code architecture).

In July 2017, I went from Bootstrap to Materialize CSS. The transition was nothing short of amazing. It's
impresive how fuild the CSS transition and translation was.

Starting October 2017, I started re-visiting a feature I discovered with my [reviews website](https://reviews.herokuapp.com):
internal messaging between users. Most apps these days have a messaging feature. I wanted this feature to become a
requirement very soon become out of scope

In June 2019, after a long pause of development from May 2018 to April 2019 (hey I have school you know!), I worked
hard refactoring the code (making it better) and decided it was time for this site to become public. The app was
now renamed to [YourAnime.moe](https://youranime.moe). A new look was implemented in February 2019, then once more
in April 2019.

In early 2021, the site's new goal was now about to promoting which anime can be watched legally in your country. I've decided to convert the Rails app into a GraphQL API that is used by a rich client, written in React. The interface has changed a lot since then and the focus is now to put then enphasis on **where** certain anime can be watched.
