### About Tanoshimu

This project was originally called _My Akinyele_ and was running Rails 4. The UI and the code design
were terrible so I decided to change everything in January 2017 for the best. A big change was the use of
Slim and the heavy use of Bootstrap (as well as better overall code architecture).

In July 2017, I went from Bootstrap to Materialize CSS. The transition was nothing short of amazing. It's
impresive how fuild the CSS transition and translation was.

Starting October 2017, I started re-visiting a feature I discovered with my [reviews website](https://reviews.herokuapp.com):
internal messaging between users. Most apps these days have a messaging feature. I wanted this feature to become a
requirement very soon become out of scope

In June 2019, after a long pause of development from May 2018 to April 2019 (hey I have school you know!), I worked
hard refactoring the code (making it better) and decided it was time for this site to become public. The app was
now renamed to [YourAnime.moe](https://youranime.moe). A new look was implemented in February 2019, then once more
in April 2019.

In early 2021, the site's new goal was now about to promoting which anime can be watched legally in your country. I've decided to convert the Rails app into a GraphQL API that is used by a rich client, written in React. The interface has changed a lot since then and the focus is now to put then enphasis on **where** certain anime can be watched.
